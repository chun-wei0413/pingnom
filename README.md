# 🍽️ Pingnom

**Bringing scattered friends together, one meal at a time**

## What is Pingnom?

Pingnom is a social dining app that solves the modern dilemma: your friends are scattered across the city at their workplaces, but you all want to grab a meal together. With a simple "ping," you can rally your crew from their desks, offices, and remote locations to share a delicious meal.

## 🎯 The Problem

- Coordinating lunch/dinner plans is chaotic 
- Group chats get messy with "where should we eat?" discussions

## ✨ The Solution

Pingnom makes it effortless to:
- **Ping your crew** - Send instant meal invitations to your friend groups
- **Smart location matching** - Find restaurants that are convenient for everyone
- **Real-time responses** - See who's available and excited to join
- **Effortless coordination** - No more endless group chat discussions
- **Discover new spots** - Explore restaurants you might never have found alone
